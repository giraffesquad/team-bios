      "bio": "<p>I have been a Full Stack Web Developer since February 2018. After receiving a Bechelor's degree from the University of New Hampshire in Business Administration with concentrations in Information Systems Management and Management in 2013, I began working as a Project Analyst at a software development company and automating anything I could find.<p><p>After a couple years of optimizing our team's processes and scaling out the home grown VBA tools, my manager pulled me aside and encouraged me to consider software development professionally. With much grace, I was able to attend the University of New Hampshire's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp for six months and was hired as a Software Developer.</p><p>This career change has awakened a natural passion in me for coding and problem solving while also serving as a creative outlet. My personality lends itself to bringing a team together for collaboration and FUN!</p><p>Tinkering with personal projects at home is great, but being present with my wife and son are much more important for me. We like hiking with our dog, reading, getting together with friends often, and serving the community of Somersworth, NH.</p>",
