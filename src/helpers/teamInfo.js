      "bio": "<p>I have been a Full Stack Web Developer since February 2018. After receiving a Bechelor's degree from the University of New Hampshire in Business Administration with concentrations in Information Systems Management and Management in 2013, I began working as a Project Analyst at a software development company and automating anything I could find.<p><p>After a couple years of optimizing our team's processes and scaling out the home grown VBA tools, my manager pulled me aside and encouraged me to consider software development professionally. With much grace, I was able to attend the University of New Hampshire's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp for six months and was hired as a Software Developer.</p><p>This career change has awakened a natural passion in me for coding and problem solving while also serving as a creative outlet. My personality lends itself to bringing a team together for collaboration and FUN!</p><p>Tinkering with personal projects at home is great, but being present with my wife and son are much more important for me. We like hiking with our dog, reading, getting together with friends often, and serving the community of Somersworth, NH.</p>",

      "title": "Software Developer",
      "bio": "<p>I have been a Full Stack Web Developer since December of 2017. Before embarking on the journey of software development, I graduated from the University of New Hampshire in May 2016 with a focus in Information Systems Management and Business Analytics. After Graduation I began my career with Liberty Mutual in their Technical Development Program, a 2 year technical rotation program where I experienced roles as a Business Analyst, UI/UX Lead, and lastly, a Full Stack Web Developer.</p><p>I have always felt a passion for the user experience. Delivering the best experience for your users should be ultimate goal for all your software efforts, right? Because if you don't have usersâ€¦ well then you just have a pretty screen, and what good is that? I view myself as an advocate for the user first and a developer second. Understanding the why behind our development efforts is important to me, because after all, Agile is all about maximizing the work NOT done. Recently, I have been exploring the role of a UX Engineer, which is a fancy name for someone who can administer user research sessions, design, and code. Sometimes referred to as a unicorn. So that is what I plan to do; embark on the journey that is becoming a unicorn!</p><p>In my free time I enjoy snowboarding, skateboarding, hockey, and most things that involve going fast. I always try to stay creative, so recently I purchased a film camera from a local flea market and try to take it with me everywhere I go. It keeps the creative juices flowing while capturing awesome memories and moments.</p>",
